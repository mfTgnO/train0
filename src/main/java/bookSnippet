As you can see, lambda expressions remove the boilerplate code inherent to the strategy design
pattern. If you think about it, lambda expressions encapsulate a piece of code (or strategy),
which is what the strategy design pattern was created for, so we recommend that you use
lambda expressions instead for similar problems.
