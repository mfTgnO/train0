Setting the Scene
Microservices are getting very popular these days. It’s not a surprise; this
software architecture style has a lot of advantages, like flexibility and ease
of scale. Mapping them into small teams in an organization also gives you
a lot of efficiency in development. However, going on the adventure of
microservices knowing only the benefits is a wrong call: you need to know
what you are facing and be prepared for that in advance. You can get a lot
of knowledge from many books and articles on the Internet but, when you
get hands-on code, the story changes.
This book covers some of the most important concepts of microservices
in a practical way, but not without explaining the concepts. First, we define
a use case: an application to build. Then we start with a small monolith,
based on some sound reasoning. Once we have the minimal application in
place, we evaluate if it’s worthy to move to microservices, and what would
be a good way to do so. How should we communicate these different pieces?
Then we can describe and introduce the event-driven architecture pattern
to reach loose coupling by informing other parts of the system about what
happened in your part of the process, instead of explicitly calling others to
action. Once you have the microservices in place, you see in practice how
the surrounding tools work: service discovery, routing, etc. We don’t cover all
of them at once but include them one by one, explaining the benefits of each
for the application. Also, we analyze what would be a good way to test the
distributed system, end-to-end.2
The advantage of going step-by-step, pausing when it’s needed to settle
down the concepts, is that you will understand which problem each tool is
trying to solve. That’s why the evolving example is an essential part of this
book. You can also grasp the concepts without coding one single line: most
of the source code is included so you can read it if you prefer.
The source code included in this book is available on the GitHub repository
https://github.com/microservices-practical. It’s divided into
different versions, which makes it easier for you to see how the application
evolves along the chapters. The book includes notes with the version that
is being covered in that section.
